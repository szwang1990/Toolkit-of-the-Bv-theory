# Toolkit-of-the-Bv-theory
Test cases of the non-breaking wave-induced mixing (the Bv theory) on ocean and climate models. Check the derivation of Bv via [Qiao et al., 2004, GRL](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2004GL019824).
## 1 the MASNUM wave model

## 2 The Bv effect in FESOM
FESOM is the first mature global ocean general circulation model based on unstructured‚Äêmesh methods. The Bv effect on improving upper-ocean simulation has been tested using [FESOM 1.4](https://fesom.de/models/fesom14/). Follow along the steps to reproduce the results of [Wang et al., 2019, JAMES].(https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018MS001494).
